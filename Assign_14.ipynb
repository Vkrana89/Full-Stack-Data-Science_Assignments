    "1. What does RGBA stand for?\n",
    "RGBA refers to the color model used to represent colors in an image. RGBA stands for Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha. It is an extension of the RGB color model, where an additional channel, the alpha channel, is included to represent the transparency or opacity of a color.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RGBA, each component (Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha) is represented by an integer value ranging from 0 to 255. The Red, Green, and Blue components determine the color itself, while the Alpha component represents the level of transparency or opacity. A higher alpha value means the color is more opaque, while a lower value means it is more transparent.\n",
    "2. From the Pillow module, how do you get the RGBA value of any images?\n",
    "In the Pillow module, you can use the getpixel() method of an Image object to get the RGBA value of any pixel in the image. Here's an example:\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "image = Image.open('image.jpg')\n",
    "rgba_value = image.getpixel((x, y))\n",
    "\n",
    "in the above code, x and y represent the coordinates of the pixel for which you want to get the RGBA value. The getpixel() method returns a tuple containing the RGBA values of the specified pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is a box tuple, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "A box tuple in the context of Pillow is a tuple that represents a rectangular region or bounding box in an image. It is defined as (left, upper, right, lower), where (left, upper) represents the coordinates of the top-left corner of the box, and (right, lower) represents the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the box. The box tuple is used to define regions of interest within an image for various operations like cropping, resizing, and pasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use your image and load in notebook then, How can you find out the width and height of an Image object?\n",
    "To find out the width and height of an Image object in Pillow, you can use the size attribute of the Image object.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What method would you call to get Image object for a 100×100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it?\n",
    "to get an Image object for a 100×100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it, you can use the crop() method. \n",
    "\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "image = Image.open('image.jpg')\n",
    "cropped_image = image.crop((0, 0, 50, 50))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. After making changes to an Image object, how could you save it as an image file?\n",
    "After making changes to an Image object in Pillow, you can save it as an image file using the save() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What module contains Pillow’s shape-drawing code?\n",
    "Pillow's shape-drawing code is contained in the ImageDraw module. You can import it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "from PIL import ImageDraw\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Image objects do not have drawing methods. What kind of object does? How do you get this kind of object?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ImageDraw objects have drawing methods in Pillow. To obtain an ImageDraw object, you can use the Draw() function from the ImageDraw module. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "from PIL import Image, ImageDraw\n",
    "\n",
    "image = Image.open('image.jpg')\n",
    "draw = ImageDraw.Draw(image)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"
