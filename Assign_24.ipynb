They are defined using the lambda keyword and can take any number of arguments but can only have a single expression as their body. Lambda expressions are often used for simple and concise functions."

Lambda expressions are useful in situations where you need a short and simple function and don't want to define a separate function using def. They are commonly used in functional programming paradigms and when working with higher-order functions."

    "Recursive functions are functions that call themselves within their own body. They are used to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller, similar subproblems and solving them recursively until a base case is reached. Recursive functions typically have a base case that defines when the recursion should stop and a recursive case that defines how the function calls itself with a modified argument. Recursive functions are useful for solving problems that can be naturally divided into smaller subproblems and often provide elegant and concise solutions."
