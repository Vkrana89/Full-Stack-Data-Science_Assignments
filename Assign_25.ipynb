    "Parentheses ( ): When a list comprehension is enclosed in parentheses, it creates a generator object, also known as a generator comprehension. The generator comprehension works similarly to a list comprehension but produces an iterator that generates values on-the-fly as they are requested, instead of creating the entire list at once. Generator comprehensions are more memory-efficient for large datasets as they do not generate the entire sequence in memory."

    "Iterators: An iterator is an object that provides a sequence of values one at a time. It implements the __iter__ and __next__ methods. Iterators can be created from iterable objects and are used to iterate over elements in a sequence or collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators: Generators are a type of iterator. They are functions or expressions that use the yield statement to generate a sequence of values. Generators can be created using generator functions or generator expressions. When a generator is iterated over, it generates values lazily, on-demand, without storing the entire sequence in memory.\n",

    "When a generator function encounters a yield statement, it pauses its execution and returns the yielded value to the caller. The generator's state is preserved, allowing it to resume execution from where it left off when the generator is iterated over or the next() function is called on it. Each time the generator is iterated or advanced, it continues from the last yield statement, producing the next value in the sequence."

    "The relationship between map calls and list comprehensions is that they both provide ways to perform transformations on iterable objects and generate new sequences based on the results.\n",
    "Map calls: The map() function takes a function and an iterable as arguments and applies the function to each element of the iterable, returning an iterator that yields the results. The map() function is useful when you want to apply a single function to each element of an iterable and collect the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions: List comprehensions are a concise way to create new lists by iterating over an iterable and applying an expression or transformation to each element. List comprehensions allow for more complex operations, including filtering elements based on conditions and performing nested iterations. They can create a new list by evaluating the expression for each element of the iterable and optionally filtering the results.\n",

    "Comparison and contrast:\n",
    "\n",
    "Map calls are generally more suitable for simple transformations where you want to apply a single function to each element of an iterable. List comprehensions offer more flexibility and expressiveness, allowing for more complex operations including filtering and nested iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Map calls return an iterator, while list comprehensions return a new list object. This means that map calls are more memory-efficient for large datasets since they generate values on-demand, while list comprehensions generate the entire list at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions can be more readable and concise in certain cases, especially when performing simple transformations or filtering operations. However, map calls can be useful when you already have a function defined separately and want to apply it to multiple elements.\n",
