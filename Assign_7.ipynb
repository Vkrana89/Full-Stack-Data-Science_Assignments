    "1. What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?\n",
    "The feature responsible for generating Regex objects is the re module in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "Raw strings are often used in Regex objects to avoid the need for excessive escaping of special characters. Raw strings treat backslashes as literal characters, which is useful in regular expressions that contain many special characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the return value of the search() method?\n",
    "\n",
    "The search() method returns a Match object, which represents the first occurrence of a pattern match in a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?\n",
    "To get the actual strings that match the pattern from a Match object, you can use the group() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In the regex which created from the r&#39;(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)&#39;, what does group zero cover? Group 2? Group 1?\n",
    "In the regex r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)', group zero covers the entire matched string. Group 2 covers the second set of digits (after the hyphen), and group 1 covers the first set of digits (before the hyphen).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell a regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods?\n",
    "To match real parentheses and periods in a regex pattern, you can use escape sequences by adding a backslash \\ before the parentheses or periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to return one of the two options?\n",
    "The findall() method returns a list of all non-overlapping matches of a pattern in a string. If the pattern contains capturing groups, it returns a list of tuples where each tuple represents a match and contains the captured groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. In standard expressions, what does the | character mean?\n",
    "In standard expressions, the | character acts as the OR operator and matches either the expression before or after it.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. In regular expressions, what does the character stand for?\n",
    "In regular expressions, the . character is a special metacharacter that matches any character except a newline character.\n",
    "\n",
    "10.In regular expressions, what is the difference between the + and * characters\n",
    "In regular expressions, the + character matches one or more occurrences of the preceding element, while the * character matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding element.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is the difference between {4} and {4,5} in regular expression?\n",
    "{4} in a regular expression matches exactly four occurrences of the preceding element, while {4,5} matches between four and five occurrences of the preceding element.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What do you mean by the \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "In regular expressions, the \\d shorthand character class matches any digit (0-9), \\w matches any alphanumeric character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and underscore), and \\s matches any whitespace character (space, tab, newline).\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What do means by \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "In regular expressions, the \\D shorthand character class matches any non-digit character, \\W matches any non-alphanumeric character, and \\S matches any non-whitespace character.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the difference between .*? and .*?\n",
    ".*? is a non-greedy match and matches as few characters as possible, while .* is a greedy match and matches as many characters as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. What is the syntax for matching both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class?\n",
    "To match both numbers and lowercase letters in a character class, you can use the range [0-9a-z].\n",
    "\n",
    "16. What is the procedure for making a normal expression in regax case insensitive?\n",
    "To make a regular expression case insensitive, you can pass the re.IGNORECASE or re.I flag as the second argument to re.compile() or use the (?i) flag in the pattern itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as 2nd argument in re.compile()?\n",
    "The . character normally matches any character except a newline. If re.DOTALL is passed as the second argument to re.compile(), the . character will also match newline characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. If numReg = re.compile(r&#39;\\d+&#39;), what will numRegex.sub(&#39;X&#39;, &#39;11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hen&#39;) return?\n",
    "The numRegex.sub('X', '11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hens') will return the string 'X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hens'.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. What does passing re.VERBOSE as the 2nd argument to re.compile() allow to do?\n",
    "Passing re.VERBOSE as the second argument to re.compile() allows you to include whitespace and comments within the regular expression pattern to improve readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. How would you write a regex that match a number with comma for every three digits? It must\n",
    "match the given following:\n",
    "&#39;42&#39;\n",
    "&#39;1,234&#39;\n",
    "&#39;6,368,745&#39;\n",
    "\n",
    "but not the following:\n",
    "&#39;12,34,567&#39; (which has only two digits between the commas)\n",
    "&#39;1234&#39; (which lacks commas)\n",
    "Answer :\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The regex pattern to match a number with commas for every three digits would be r'^\\d{1,3}(,\\d{3})*$'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "21. How would you write a regex that matches the full name of someone whose last name is\n",
    "Watanabe? You can assume that the first name that comes before it will always be one word that\n",
    "begins with a capital letter. The regex must match the following:\n",
    "&#39;Haruto Watanabe&#39;\n",
    "&#39;Alice Watanabe&#39;\n",
    "&#39;RoboCop Watanabe&#39;\n",
    "but not the following:\n",
    "&#39;haruto Watanabe&#39; (where the first name is not capitalized)\n",
    "&#39;Mr. Watanabe&#39; (where the preceding word has a nonletter character)\n",
    "&#39;Watanabe&#39; (which has no first name)\n",
    "&#39;Haruto watanabe&#39; (where Watanabe is not capitalized)\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "The regex pattern to match the full name of someone whose last name is Watanabe would be r'^[A-Z][a-zA-Z]*\\sWatanabe$'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "22. How would you write a regex that matches a sentence where the first word is either Alice, Bob,\n",
    "or Carol; the second word is either eats, pets, or throws; the third word is apples, cats, or baseballs;\n",
    "and the sentence ends with a period? This regex should be case-insensitive. It must match the\n",
    "following:\n",
    "&#39;Alice eats apples.&#39;\n",
    "&#39;Bob pets cats.&#39;\n",
    "&#39;Carol throws baseballs.&#39;\n",
    "&#39;Alice throws Apples.&#39;\n",
    "&#39;BOB EATS CATS.&#39;\n",
    "but not the following:\n",
    "&#39;RoboCop eats apples.&#39;\n",
    "&#39;ALICE THROWS FOOTBALLS.&#39;\n",
    "&#39;Carol eats 7 cats.&#39;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    " The regex pattern to match a sentence where the first word is either Alice, Bob, or Carol; the second word is either eats, pets, or throws; the third word is apples, cats, or baseballs; and the sentence ends with a period would be r'^(Alice|Bob|Carol)\\s(eats|pets|throws)\\s(apples|cats|baseballs)\\.$' with the re.IGNORECASE flag."
